microservice - small service

SOA (big) vs microservice (small)

common characteristics of microservices
componentization via service
organized around businss capabilities
projects not projects
smart endpoints and dumb pipes
decentralized governance
decentralized data management
infrastructure automation
design for failure
evolutionary design

self hosting
hosting service
virtual hosting service
platform as a service (PaaS)
containers (such as Docker)

each microservice could be a web server, a data source, or a combination of the two: 
no hard distinctionin other words, 
each can have own persistence layermicroservices 
pros vs monolith SOA
    'hey, we want this new feature, let's add it to existing codebase 
	vs. let's add a new, separate service'    
pro: more flexible deployment / scaling    
pro: get away from heavy-weight dependencies, overly-prescriptive frameworks    
pro: cuts down friction in large organizations    
pro: get away from single-language, -platform dependence    
pro: embrace component failure / redundency    
con: more network overhead    
con: consistency / coherence problems    
con: if you get too fine-grained, the services often get too abstract    
con: adds unnecessary indirection / fracturing for small teams        
con: end up with large system composed out of excessive number of languages/platforms    
con: constructing out of smaller pieces may require more glue    
con: embrace component failure / redundency: tolerating/hiding bugs that should be fixed    
con: how do I debug across separate services?
